## ⚖️ What is Moot Court?

Moot Court is a **mock version of appellate court proceedings** (not a trial court). Students argue a legal issue before a judge, often in pairs (one arguing for the appellant/petitioner and one for the respondent).

Unlike trial courts:

* **No witness examination**
* Focuses on **legal arguments**, **case law**, and **interpretation**
