## üîç Types of Jurisprudence

| Type                                     | Description                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Analytical Jurisprudence**          | Studies law as it is (**positive law**), not how it should be. Focus on legal definitions, concepts, and structure. (e.g., Austin's theory) |
| **2. Natural Law (Moral Jurisprudence)** | Law must be based on **morality**, **justice**, and **universal principles**. (e.g., Aquinas, Locke)                                        |
| **3. Historical Jurisprudence**          | Law evolves with **society, custom, and tradition**. (e.g., Savigny)                                                                        |
| **4. Sociological Jurisprudence**        | Law is a **social tool** to meet society‚Äôs needs. Focuses on its **impact**. (e.g., Roscoe Pound)                                           |
| **5. Realist Jurisprudence**             | Law in **action**, not in books. Judges, psychology, and social context matter. (e.g., Oliver Wendell Holmes)                               |
| **6. Feminist Jurisprudence**            | Examines how law affects **women and gender roles**. Challenges male-dominated legal norms.                                                 |
